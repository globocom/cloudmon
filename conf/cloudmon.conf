# CloudMon Configuration File
###############################################################################
#
#   This is an example to show how to edit the configuration file.
#
#   Values should be assigned to one field using the equal operator.
#
#   If a field is omitted, its default value will be assigned unless the field
# is required, then CloudMon won't start.
#
#   Multiple assigned values (lists) should be separated by comma, unless the
# comments state otherwise.
#
#   Values: true, t, yes, y, 1, False, f, no, n, 0 (case insensitive) are
# interpreted as booleans.
#
#   Quotes are usually not needed, unless a value starts or ends with
# whitespace, or contains a quote mark or comma, then it should be surrounded
# by quotes.
#
#   Sections are designated by square brackets before and after the section
# name. The number of square brackets represents the nesting level of the
# sub-section.
#
#   One section ends when another section starts. So, it's recommended
# to not change the order of the fields in this file.
#
#   Comments start with a #, possibly preceded by whitespace.
#
#   Multi-line entries can be done using triple quotes.
#       field = '''
#           This is a multi-line entry
#       '''
#
#   Indentation is not significant, but can be preserved.
#
#   Extra files can be included using: +include name_and_path_of_the_file
# The contents of the included file will be added at the place
# where the directive +include was passed.
